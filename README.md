# Chess-Position-History-Tool

This tool requests a PGN or list of chess moves, searches a database of over 20,000 online chess games, and returns a list of all moves that have occurred in games that reached the same position through the given PGN/moves. The tool also returns how many games have continued with each move, and how frequently the games resulted in a victory for white, a victory for black, and a draw. The user has the option of seeing only games in a specific rating range and seeing only rated games (games that would affect the players' ratings). The user can explore specific lines (sequences of chess moves) that stem from the moves they originally inputted and receive the same information about them. This tool is useful for chess players looking to analyze specific positions and lines of play so they can evaluate players' success in the same situations in previous games.
